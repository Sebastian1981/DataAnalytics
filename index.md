## My Professional Background
I am a physicist, former researcher and now passionate data scientist with experience in healthcare and renewable energies. After i graduated in physics, I spent nine years in academia in the role of a PhD student and postdoctoral researcher. I applied physics, maths and statistics to solve many real-world challenges in medical imaging and signal processing publishing the key findings in peer-reviewed research journals or at international conferences. After academia, I gained a wide range of experience in the renewable energy industry in the role of a data scientist consulting various departments on using data science to solve business problems. Thereby, I developed and validated machine-learning (ml) models in numerous proof-of-concept (PoC) studies within an agile developer team. I also supported the ml-engineers with the deployment and monitoring of models. By now I am working as a freelance data scientist and am glad to provide you with support for interesting data science or optimization projects.

## My Role and Expertise
I am able to quickly familiarizing myself with a specialist domain to support the challenging task of translating a business problem into a value-added data science or optimization use case. Technically, my expertise lies in the rapid development of data understanding and data modeling in the context of PoC studies. Furthermore, I see myself able to explain the key results of a PoC-study in a generally understandable way for all stakeholders. If a model turns out to create real added value not only in the PoC but also in practice, I can support the developer team with the deployment.

## My Value Proposition
- explaining data science to both technical and non-technical audiences
- supporting the specialist department to translate business questions into well defined data science and/or optimization use cases
- implementing an evaluating ml-model prototypes for data science use cases
- implementing mathematical and heuristic models for linear and non-linear optimization use cases
- presenting the key analytical findings in a clear and understandable way to both technical and non-technical audiences 
- supporting with the deployment of the models

Do you want to tackle data science or optimization projects in your company? Or do you need support in developing ml- or mathematical models? Feel free to get in touch with me - I look forward to supporting you with my expertise and making data science and optimization usable in your company.
