# My personal background
I am a former physicist with more than 10 years of experience in academic research applying profound knowledge in medical physics, maths and statistics to solve many challenges in in the fields of magnetic resonance imaging mostly by improving data acquisition and/or developing smarter image- and signal-processing strategies. 





and passionate data scientist with over 10 years of research background in physics, statistics, signal and image processing and over 4 years of industry experience in implementing data science solutions and data science consulting. My personal interest in the field of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) is broad and ranges from classical machine learning use cases like churn prediction or outlier detection to more advanced deep-learning challenges like computer-vision or natural language processing. 

My focus is on the development of so-called "responsible" AI systems which are by definition explainable and fair. Model explainability means that the AI decision proccess is transparent, understandable and relieable. Model fairness means that the AI-system does not decide in favor of or against a specific ethnic or population group. Model explainability and model fairness are thus two important properties for customer analytics use cases like churn prediction, customer-lifetime-value prediction, customer segmentation, credit default scoring, health-risk modeling and many more. Sufficient data provided, it is often times possible to develop highly performant "black-box" AI models. However, these black-box models often times lead to intransparent decision making or potentially treat your current or potential future customers unfairly which may cause extra direct or indirect costs. My personal goal and passion is about developing highly performant and at the same time responsible AI-systems to solve real-world customer analytics challenges in a transparent and ethical manner.

As a freelance data scientist, I would be very happy to work along your side on state of the art customer analytics projects to solve real-world challenges using responsible AI.
