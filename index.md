## My Personal Background
I am passionate Data Scientist and former researcher with more than 10 years of experience in academic research applying profound knowledge in medical physics, maths and statistics to solve many real-world challenges in applied medical imaging. After my time in research, I gained a wide range of experience in the renewable energy industry in the role of a data scientist as an algorithm developer and consultant for various departments for the development of data-driven anlytics solutions.

My favourite quote:
*“It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.” ― Richard P. Feynman ―*
## My Mission
My mission is the development of  explainable and fair machine learning models to solve real-world business challenges. Often times, complex state-of-the art machine learning models are highly performant but at the same time lack transparency (so called "black-box" models). The past has shown that black-box models are rarely used on a daily basis to support the business due to understandable mistrust of the end-users. Another crucial requirement of modern machine learning models especially when applied to customer analytics challenges is that they are not only performant and explainable but also lead to fair decision making i.e. not favoring one group of people over the other e.g. based on gender or ethnical background. My personal goal and passion is about developing highly performant, explainable and fair machine learning models to solve real-world data analytics challenges to help the business.
## My Expertise
According to my academic and industry experience in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, my main competencies lie in the areas of time series analysis and customer analytics. Time series analyzes includes use cases such as demand or load forecasts, machine failure forecasts (predictive maintenance) or anomaly detection. Customer analytics includes use cases such as churn prediction, customer-lifetime-value prediction, customer segmentation or in a wider sense health-risk models and many more. 
Through my personal interest in cloud computing and my hand-on mentality, I found that Microsoft Azure is an excellent ecosystem for designing and implementing explainable and fair machine learning models in a secure and productive environment. In order to further expand my data science skills in Azure, I am particularly looking forward to exciting data science projects in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.
## My Offer
As a passionate and experienced freelance data scientist, I would be happy to work along your side on state-of-the art customer analytics or time-series analysis projects especially in Microsoft Azure to solve your business challenges by leveraging the power data combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I can help with the following challenges:
- translating business-specific questions of the specialist department into well defined data science use cases
- performing proof-of-concept (POC) studies inside and outside of Azure Machine Learning Studio as efficiently and quickly as possible including the following steps: exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, model tuning and model selection
- presenting the key analytical findings in a clear and understandable way to both technical and non-technical audiences 
- model deployment in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio as a real-time and scalable web service
- implementing a monitoring service in Azure Machine Learning Studio to track model performance and data-drifts over time
- implementing and deploy Azure´s Cognitive Services such as text analytics and computer vision
- hand over projects to the data science and data engineering team in form of clean, modularized and well documented code

So if you think that I can help you and your company with my data science expertise, you are very welcome to contact me via Xing, LinkedIn or email to clarify the project details. 
My favorite data science projects are characterized by a clear goal and a continuous and close coordination with all stake holders, including data scientists, data engineers and domain experts from the department.
