*“It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.” ― Richard P. Feynman ―*


## My Professional Background
I am a physicist and data scientist with 4 years of professional experience in applying machine learning to improve data-driven marketing analytics. I developed state-of-the-art machine learning models for use cases such as customer value prediction, customer segmentation, marketing engagement and churn prediction. Moreover, I consulted various specialist departments on using data science to solve different business problems. Thereby, I developed and validated machine-learning models in numerous proof-of-concept studies. I also supported the machine learning engineers and software developers with the deployment and monitoring of the models. By now I am working as a freelance data scientist and am glad to provide you with support for interesting data science projects. Before transitioning into the world of data science I worked as an academic researcher for 10 years and gained deep insights into medical physics, medical imaging, signal processing, mathematics, statistics and regression analysis. 

## My Value Proposition
- consultation on marketing analytics use cases such as customer value prediction, customer segmentation, sales prediction, marketing engagement and churn prediction
- supporting specialist departments to translate business questions into well defined data science use cases
- implementing an evaluating model prototypes
- presenting the key analytical findings in a clear and understandable way to both technical and non-technical audiences 
- supporting the development team with the deployment of the models
