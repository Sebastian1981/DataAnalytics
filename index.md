## My Background
I am physicist, former researcher and now passionate data scientist with experience in healthcare and renewable energies. After i graduated in physics, I spent nine years in academia in the role of a PhD student and postdoctoral researcher. I applied physics, maths and statistics to solve many real-world challenges in medical imaging and signal processing publishing key findings in international research journals. After academia, I gained a wide range of experience in the renewable energy industry in the role of a data scientist consulting various departments on using data science to solve business problems. Thereby, I developed and validated machine-learning (ML) models in numerous proof-of-concept (PoC) studies within an agile developer team. I also supported the machine learning engineers with the deployment and monitoring of the models. Now I work as a freelance data scientist and I would be happy to provide you with support for interesting data science projects.

## My Expertise
I have some experience in quickly familiarizing myself with a specialist domain to support the challenging task of translating a business problem into a value-added data science use case. Technically, my expertise lies in the rapid development of data understanding and data modeling in the context of PoC studies. Furthermore, I see myself able to explain the key results of a PoC-study, and above all the strengths and weaknesses of an ML-model, in a generally understandable way. If a model turns out to create real added value not only in the PoC but also in practice, I can support the developer team with the deployment.

## My Most Effective Role
I work most effectively in a team of data scientists, data engineers, machine learning engineers and colleagues from the specialist department. Thereby, the core competence of the data scientist lies in the development of data understanding, data modeling and close communication with the specialist department. The core competence of the data engineer lies in the storage, migration and processing of data. The core competence of the machine learning engineer lies in the production and operation of the models.

## My Value Proposition
- explaining data science to both technical and non-technical audiences
- supporting the specialist department to translate business questions into well defined data science use cases
- rapid ML-prototyping
- presenting the key analytical findings in a clear and understandable way to both technical and non-technical audiences 
- supporting with ML-model deployment
- supporting an agil developer team with structured thinking and good code quality
