## My Personal Background
I am passionate data scientist (not an machine learning engineer) and former researcher with more than 10 years of experience in academic research applying profound knowledge in medical physics, maths and statistics to solve many real-world challenges in applied medical imaging. After academia, I gained a wide range of experience in the renewable energy industry in the role of a data scientist implementing machine learning models and consulting various departments for the development of data-driven solutions.

My favourite quote:
*“It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.” ― Richard P. Feynman ―*
## My Mission
My mission is designing and implementing data science solutions to solve real-world business challenges. Thereby, I have specialized on developing "responsible" machine models for personal data and time series data meaning that two important criteria are met which are model explainability and model fairness. Often times, complex state-of-the art machine learning models are highly performant but at the same time lack explainability (so called "black-box" models). The past has shown that black-box models are rarely used on a daily basis to support the business due to understandable mistrust of the end-users. Another crucial requirement of modern machine learning models especially when applied to customer analytics challenges (i.e. personal data) is that they lead to fair decision making i.e. not favoring one group of people over the other e.g. based on gender or ethnical background etc. My personal goal and passion is about developing highly performant, explainable and fair machine learning models to solve real-world data analytics challenges to support business decision making.
## My Expertise
According to my academic and industry experience in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, my main expertises are firstly, translating business-specific questions of the specialist department into well defined data science use cases. Secondly, performing proof-of-concept (POC) studies inside and outside of Azure Machine Learning Studio as efficiently and quickly as possible including the following steps: exploratory data analysis, (automated) feature engineering, model training and evaluation, model tuning and selection or automated machine learning (auto-ml). Last but not least, presenting and communicating the key analytical findings in a clear and understandable way to both technical and non-technical audiences.

With respect to specific data science use cases, i gained profound knowledge in time series analyses and forecasting and customer analytics. Time series use cases include e.g. demand or load forecasts, machine failure forecasts in the context of predictive maintenance or anomaly detection. Customer analytics use cases deal primarily with personal data and include e.g. churn prediction, customer-lifetime-value prediction, customer segmentation or in a wider sense health-risk models and many more.

Through my personal interest in cloud computing, I gained profound knowledge using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Service for designing and implementing explainable and fair machine learning models in a secure and productive environment. In order to further expand my data science skills in Azure, I am particularly looking forward to exciting data science projects in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.
## My Offer
As an experienced data scientist, I would be happy to work along your side on state-of-the art analytics projects, especially in Microsoft Azure, to solve your business challenges by leveraging the power big data and machine learning combined with the capabilities of cloud-computing.

As a data scientist (not to be confused with a machine learning engineer), I can help with the following challenges:
- translating business-specific questions of the specialist department into well defined data science use cases
- developing explainable and fair machine learning models within proof-of-concept (POC) studies inside and outside of Azure Machine Learning Studio as efficiently and quickly as possible including the following steps: exploratory data analysis, (automated) feature engineering, model training and evaluation, model tuning and selection or automated machine learning (auto-ml)
- presenting the key analytical findings in a clear and understandable way to both technical and non-technical audiences 
- model deployment as a real-time and scalable web service in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio
- implementing Azure services to monitor the model´s performance and data-drifts 
- hand over projects to the machine learning engineers in form of clean, modularized and well documented code

You are very welcome to contact me via Xing, LinkedIn or email to clarify the project details. My favorite data science projects are characterized by a clear goal, lots of available data and a continuous and close colaboration with all stake holders including data scientists, data engineers, machine learning engineers and domain experts. Moreover, clear role definitions of the data scientist, machine learning engineers (e.g. MLOps) and data engineers is crucial. The basis for negotiation for my hourly rate is 90€ (before taxes). I am available for your project from Monday to Thursday, preferably remote.
