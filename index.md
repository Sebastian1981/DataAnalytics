*“It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.” ― Richard P. Feynman ―*


## My Professional Background
I have 6 years of professional experience in applying state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms to the fields of marketing analytics, healthcare and natural language processing. My work included developing and validating machine-learning models for use cases such as customer value prediction, customer segmentation, churn prediction, disease prediction, and AI-based SEO-content generation. I consulted various specialist departments on translating business problems into well-defined data science use cases, as well as supporting machine learning engineers and software developers with the deployment and monitoring of models. Additionally, I bring 10 years of research experience in medical physics, medical imaging, signal processing, mathematics, statistics, and regression analysis from my past work as an academic researcher.
