## My Personal Background
I am passionate Data Scientist and former researcher with more than 10 years of experience in academic research applying profound knowledge in medical physics, maths and statistics to solve many real-world challenges in applied medical imaging. After my time in research, I gained a wide range of experience in the renewable energy industry in the role of a data scientist as an algorithm developer and consultant for various departments for the development of data-driven solutions.

## My Expertise to Support You
My core competencies are to support specialist departments in translating business-specific questions into data science use cases, to implement proof-of-concept (POC) studies as efficiently and quickly as possible and to evaluate machine learnig model performances with respect to reasonable business metrics. I present the key-findings of a POC study in a clear and understandable way to both technical and non-technical audiences. In addition, I hand over projects to the ML-Ops developer team in form of clean, modularized and well documented code.

According to my previous academic and industry experience in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, my main competencies lie in the areas of time series analysis and customer analytics. Time series analyzes includes, for example, use cases such as demand or load forecasts, machine failure forecasts (predictive maintenance) or anomaly detection. Customer analytics includes use cases such as churn prediction, customer-lifetime-value prediction, customer segmentation or in a wider sense health-risk models and many more. Moreover, due to my personal interest in financial data analysis, I can develop e.g. credit default models, stock models or apply capital asset prizing models for portfolio optimization.

Independent of the use case, my focus is on the development of  transparent and explainable machine learning models. Often times, highly complex state-of-the art machine learning models are highly performant but at the same time these models are often intransparent (so called "black-box" models). The experience over the last decade has shown that these black-box models are not or barely used to support the business in the daily routine due to the lack of transparency and therefore mistrust of the end-users. My personal goal and passion is about developing highly performant but also explainable AI-models to solve real-world data analytics challenges.

## My Offer 
As a passionate and experienced freelance data scientist, I would be happy to work along your side on state-of-the art customer analytics or time series forecasting projects to solve real-world challenges leveraging the power of explainable AI.
