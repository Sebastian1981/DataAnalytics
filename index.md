## Professional Background
I am a former researcher and now passionate data scientist with more than ten years of experience in academic research applying profound knowledge in medical physics, maths and statistics to solve many real-world challenges in applied medical imaging and signal processing. In the next four years after academia, I gained a wide range of experience in the renewable energy industry in the role of a data scientist. I consulted various departments on how to implement data science solution to solve specific business problems. I also implemented numerous machine-learning (ML) models in proof-of-concept (PoC) studies. I have been a freelance data scientist since 2022 and am very happy to provide you with support for interesting AI projects.

## Expertise
I have specialized on rapid ML-prototyping and on fast automation of ML-workflows using open-source, often low-code, python libraries. ML-workflows include the development of model prototypes, model deployment and also monitoring data and model drifts over time. Over the last couple of years numerous of low-code ML-libraries have been published allowing to speed up the ML-workflows exponentially which significantly benefits the productivity of data scientists or the whole developer team of data engineers, ml-engineers and data scientists.

## Value Proposition
- Explaining data science to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Supporting the specialist department to translate business questions into well defined data science use cases
- Rapid ML-prototyping
- Presenting the key analytical findings in a clear and understandable way to both technical and non-technical audiences 
- Supporting ML-model deployment
- Supporting an agil developer team with structured thinking and clean code
