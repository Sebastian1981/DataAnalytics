*“It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.” ― Richard P. Feynman ―*


## My Professional Background
I have 10+ years of professional experience in applying state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms in academic research in the field of medical physics and also in the renewable energy, medical technology and media industry. I have developed data modeling techniques for use cases related to medical imaging (e.g. ai-based mapping of the oxygen extraction fraction for disease detection), related to marketing analytics (e.g. customer value prediction, churn prediction, conversion rate prediction or customer segmentation) or related to natural language processing (e.g. search engine optimized content generation). Further, I consulted various specialist departments on translating business problems into well-defined data science use cases, as well as supporting machine learning engineers, data engineers and software developers with the deployment and monitoring of the models.

## My Vision and Future Goals
I am a passionate and highly motivated physicist and data scientist. I am driven to use innovative solutions to solve complex problems in the era of Industrial Revolution 4.0 powered by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, big data analytics and cloud computing. These technologies enable businesses to better understand customers and markets, optimize operational efficiency and production processes, and create new business opportunities. Data science and artificial intelligence are two key components of the current Industrial Revolution as they are used to collect and analyze data to gain insights and create predictive models that can be used to optimize business processes. I am committed to continuously developing my skills in these areas ensuring I am always at the forefront of technology. With my ambition and enthusiasm, I am confident I can make a positive contribution to any organization I join.
