In the following, I provide an overview of the relevant data science projects I conducted throughout the years. They will be subdivided into the categories "industry-related projects" and "personal-interest projects". In case you are interested any of the scientific projects I was involved in, please check out my scientific publications.

The model further classifies 69% of all unhealthy subjects as unhealthy while 31% are misclassified as being healthy. Using a decision threshold of 0.5 leads to an overall accuracy score of the model of 72%, a recall score of 69%, a precision score of 73% and thus a f1 score of 71%. The roc-auc score is 78%.
