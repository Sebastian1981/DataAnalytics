In the following, I provide an overview of the relevant data science projects I conducted throughout the years in academia and industry. They will be subdivided into three major categories such as industry related projects, research related projects or personal interest projects. Technically, the projects will be sub-categorized into five groups such as regression, classification, clustering, image analysis and natural language processing. 

## Industry Projects

| Use Case | Project Goal | my Role | Skills & Tools |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Disease Detection - Classification** ![brain_volumetry](images/projects/brain_volumetry.png) | Identification of pathological cerebral changes | *I developed explainable classification models (supervised machine learning) providing disease propensity scores based on labeled MRI volumetry datasets. The proof-of-concept study also included data preparation, data visualization and model performance evaluation and model optimization. In addition, I researched and documented relevant publications in this context. Finally, I handed over the project repository in a well-developed and documented state to the machine learning engineering team.* | Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Image Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Explainable AI (shapley values), Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, shap) Jupter Notebook, Google-Colab, VSCode, Gitlab |
| **Purchase Analysis Model - Classification** ![maverick_buying](images/projects/maverick_buying.png)| Identification of incorrect order processes | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing propensity scores for incorrect orders based on labeled purchasing datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I deployed the model in SPSS modeler.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Natural Language Processing (bag-of-words), Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib), R, Jupter Notebook, RStudio, Spyder, SPSS Modeler |
| **Machine Failure Forecast - Classification** ![pred_maintenance](images/projects/pred_maintenance.png)| Predict machine failure of wind turbines | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing propensity scores for imminent failure of wind turbines based on weather and sensory data. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, SPSS Modeler |
| **Default Forecast - Classification** ![creditworthyness](images/projects/creditworthyness.png)| Identification of upcoming payment defaults | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing the propensity scores of upcoming payment defaults based on labeled historical datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use.* | Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras), Jupter Notebook, VSCode |
| **Data Deduplication - Classification / Clustering** ![entity_res](images/projects/entity_res.png)| Removing duplicate names and addresses | *I developed a classification / clustering model (semi-supervised active machine learning) to detect and remove duplicates of names and addresses based on labeled datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use. I also supported the data engineering and software development team with the deployment of the model.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, dedupe), Jupter Notebook, VSCode, git |
