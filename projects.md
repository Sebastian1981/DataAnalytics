In the following, I provide an overview of the relevant data science projects I conducted throughout the years. They will be subdivided into three major categories such as industry related projects, research related projects or personal interest projects. 

## Industry Projects
<br/>

| Use Case | Project Goal | my Role | Skills & Tools |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Disease Detection Model** ![brain_volumetry](images/projects/brain_volumetry.png) | Identification of pathological cerebral changes | *I developed explainable classification models (supervised machine learning) providing disease propensity scores based on labeled MRI volumetry datasets. The proof-of-concept study also included data preparation, data visualization and model performance evaluation and model optimization. In addition, I researched and documented relevant publications in this context. Finally, I handed over the project repository in a well-developed and documented state to the machine learning engineering team.* | Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Image Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Explainable AI (shapley values), Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, shap) Jupter Notebook, Google-Colab, VSCode, Gitlab |
