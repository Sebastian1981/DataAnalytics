In the following, I provide an overview of the relevant data science projects I conducted throughout the years in academia and industry. They will be subdivided into three major categories such as industry related projects, research related projects or personal interest projects. Technically, the projects will be sub-categorized into five groups such as regression, classification, clustering, image analysis and natural language processing. 

## Industry Projects

| Use Case | Project Goal | my Role | Skills & Tools |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Disease Detection - Classification** ![brain_volumetry](images/projects/brain_volumetry.png) | Identification of pathological cerebral changes | *I developed explainable classification models (supervised machine learning) providing disease propensity scores based on labeled MRI volumetry datasets. The proof-of-concept study also included data preparation, data visualization and model performance evaluation and model optimization. In addition, I researched and documented relevant publications in this context. Finally, I handed over the project repository in a well-developed and documented state to the machine learning engineering team.* | Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Image Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Explainable AI (shapley values), Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, shap) Jupter Notebook, Google-Colab, VSCode, Gitlab |
| **Maverick Buying - Classification** ![maverick_buying](images/projects/maverick_buying.png)| Identification of orders that are processed without purchasing | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing maverick-buying propensity scores based on labeled purchasing datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I deployed the model in SPSS.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Natural Language Processing (bag-of-words), Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib), R, Jupter Notebook, RStudio, Spyder, SPSS Modeler |
| **Predictive Maintenance - Classification** ![pred_maintenance](images/projects/pred_maintenance.png)| Predict icing and thus failure of a wind turbine | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing the propensity scores of imminent icing of wind turbines based on historical sensor datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, SPSS Modeler |
| **Default Forecast - Classification** ![creditworthyness](images/projects/creditworthyness.png)| Identification of upcoming payment defaults for grid fees from electricity suppliers | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing the propensity scores of upcoming payment defaults for grid feed based on labeled historical datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use.* | Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras), Jupter Notebook, VSCode |
| **Entity Resolution - Classification / Clustering** ![entity_res](images/projects/entity_res.png)| Identification of Customers | *I developed a classification / clustering model (semi-supervised active machine learning) providing cluster numbers and propensity scores for customers belonging to a particular cluster i.e. entity based on labeled datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use. I also supported the data engineering and software development team with the deployment of the model.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, dedupe), Jupter Notebook, VSCode, git |
