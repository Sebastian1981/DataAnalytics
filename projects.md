In the following, you´ll find an overview of my project experiences in healthcare and the renewable energy industry. They are subdivided into two major groups. In group one you´ll find a brief description of the the machine learning projects I carried out as a [data science professional](#data-science-professional-projects-on-machine-learning-and-optimization). In the second group you´ll find a brief description of the the projects related to machine learning and optimization I carried out as an [academic researcher](#academic-research-projects-on-machine-learning-and-optimization). Last but not least, I put together some [side-hustle-projects](#side-hustle-projects-on-machine-learning-and-optimization) I implemented in my spare time just for fun, curiosity or my eagerness to expand my knowlede in the field of machine learning and optimization.
