In the field of data science and artificial intelligence, it is often usefull to classify projects into the five major technical categories of regression, classification, clustering, image analysis and natural language processing. Furthermore, in the following the projects will be differentiated according to the environment in which they were conducted such as industry projects, research projects or personal interest projects.

## Industry Projects


| Use Case | Project Type | Project Goal | my Role | Skills & Tools |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Disease Detection** ![brain_volumetry](images/projects/brain_volumetry.png)| Classification Challenge (*supervised learning*) | Identification of Pathological Cerebral Changes | *I developed explainable classification machine learning models providing disease propensity scores based on MRI volumetry datasets. The proof-of-concept study also included data preparation, data visualization and model performance evaluation and model optimization. In addition, I researched and documented relevant publications in this context. Finally, I handed over the project repository in a well-developed and documented state to the machine learning engieering team.* | Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Image Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Explainable AI (shapley values), Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, shap) Jupter Notebook, Google-Colab, VSCode, Gitlab |
| **Maverick Buying** ![maverick_buying](images/projects/maverick_buying.png)| Classification Challenge (*supervised learning*) | Identification of orders that are processed without purchasing | *I developed a classification machine learning model providing maverick-buying propensity scores based on labeled purchasing datasets. The proof-of-concept study also included data preparation, data visualization and model performance evaluation and optimization. The model was deployed in SPSS modeler.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib), R, Jupter Notebook, RStudio, Spyder, SPSS Modeler |
