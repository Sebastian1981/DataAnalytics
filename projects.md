In the field of data science and artificial intelligence, it is often usefull to classify projects into the five major technical categories of regression, classification, clustering, image analysis and natural language processing. Furthermore, in the following the projects will be differentiated according to the environment in which they were conducted such as industry projects, research projects or personal interest projects.

## Industry Projects


| Use Case | Project Type | Project Goal | my Role | Skills & Tools |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Disease Detection** ![brain_volumetry](images/projects/brain_volumetry.png)| Classification Challenge (*proof-of-concept study*) | Identification of pathological cerebral changes | *I developed explainable classification models (supervised machine learning) providing disease propensity scores based on labeled MRI volumetry datasets. The proof-of-concept study also included data preparation, data visualization and model performance evaluation and model optimization. In addition, I researched and documented relevant publications in this context. Finally, I handed over the project repository in a well-developed and documented state to the machine learning engineering team.* | Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Image Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Explainable AI (shapley values), Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, shap) Jupter Notebook, Google-Colab, VSCode, Gitlab |
| **Maverick Buying** ![maverick_buying](images/projects/maverick_buying.png)| Classification Challenge (*proof-of-concept study with deployment*) | Identification of orders that are processed without purchasing | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing maverick-buying propensity scores based on labeled purchasing datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I deployed the model in SPSS.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib), R, Jupter Notebook, RStudio, Spyder, SPSS Modeler |
| **Predictive Maintenance** ![pred_maintenance](images/projects/pred_maintenance.png)| Classification Challenge (*proof-of-concept study*) | Identification of local weather conditions that lead to icing and thus failure of a wind turbine | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing the propensity scores of imminent icing of wind turbines based on historical sensor datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use.* | Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, SPSS Modeler |
| **Default Forecast** ![creditworthyness](images/projects/creditworthyness.png)| Classification Challenge (*proof-of-concept study*) | Identification of upcoming payment defaults for grid fees from electricity suppliers | *I developed a classification model (supervised machine learning) providing the propensity scores of upcoming payment defaults for grid feed based on labeled historical datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use.* | Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras), Jupter Notebook, VSCode |
| **Entity Resolution** ![entity_res](images/projects/entity_res.png)| Classification / Clustering Challenge (*proof-of-concept study with deployment*) | Identification of Customers | *I developed a classification / clustering model (semi-supervised active machine learning) providing cluster numbers and propensity scores for customers belonging to a particular cluster i.e. entity based on labeled datasets. I further prepared the data, visualized the data and evaluated and optimized the model performance. I also supported the specialist department in an advisory capacity in evaluating the benefit of the model in the event of potential productive use. I also supported the data engineering team with the deployment of the model.* | Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Preparation, Data Visualization, Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras), Jupter Notebook, VSCode |
