In the following, I provide an overview of the projects I was involved in related to data science and machine learning (ml). They will be subdivided into three major groups, which are the ml-projects I carried out as [data science professional](#data-science-professional-ml-projects), as [academic researcher](#academic-research-ml-projects) and as [free time developer](#free-time-developer-ml-projects).
