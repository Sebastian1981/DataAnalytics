Try out my machine learning apps I implemented just for fun and curriosity. The apps are deployed in the streamlit cloud. The links to access my ml-apps are provided below:

- [Covid Prediction App](#covid-prediction-app)
- [Credit Default Prediction App](#credit-default-prediction-app)

## **COVID Prediction App**
| **Use Case** | **Project Goal** | **Implementation** | **Skills & Tools** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ***Credit Default*** ![default_pred_app](images/projects/default_pred_app.png) <small><small>*Image courtesy: kindpng.com*</small> | *To predict credit default risks* | *In my free time I implemented a classification model, trained on tabular data, to predict credit default risks. I deployed the model in docker with streamlit for both backend and frontend. (The code and more details are provided in my github. https://sebastian1981-covid-prediction-streamlit-appapp-i8x7ho.streamlitapp.com/)* | *Machine Learning, Data Preparation, Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, shap, streamlit, docker), Jupyter, VSCode* |
