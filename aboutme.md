*“It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.” ― Richard P Feynman ―*

I am a physicist and data scientist with over 10 years of research background in statistics and signal processing and over 4 years of industry experience in implementing data science solutions and data science consulting. 

My personal interest in the field of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) is broad and ranges from the classical machine learning problems like classification and regression tasks to highly sophisticated deep-learning challenges like computer-vision and natural language processing. However, my focus is on the development of responsible AI systems which are by definition explainable and fair. Informative data provided, it is often times possible to develop highly performing AI models, which however are neither explainable nor fair. These so-called "black box" AI-systems tend to make non-transparent and discriminatory decisions, which result in direct or indirect costs. Responsible AI systems, on the other hand, are characterized by transparency and fairness. These properties are particularly important for use cases with personal data (e.g. churn score, customer value, customer segmentation, credit default score, health risk score).
