I am a physicist and data scientist with over 10 years of research background in statistics and signal processing and over 4 years of industry experience in data science implementation and consulting. So-called "AI black box" systems may be high-performing, but tend to make non-transparent and discriminatory decisions, which result in direct or indirect costs. Responsible AI systems, on the other hand, are characterized by transparency and fairness. These properties are particularly important for use cases with personal data (e.g. churn score, customer value, customer segmentation, credit default score, health risk score).
