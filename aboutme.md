*“It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.” ― Richard P Feynman ―*

I am a physicist and data scientist with over 10 years of research background in statistics, signal and image processing and over 4 years of industry experience in implementing data science solutions and data science consulting. My personal interest in the field of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) is broad and ranges from the classical machine learning tasks like churn prediction or outlier detection to highly sophisticated deep-learning challenges like computer-vision or natural language processing. 

My special focus is on the development of so-called "responsible" AI systems which are by definition explainable and fair. These properties are particularly important for customer analytics use cases like churn prediction, customer-lifetime-value prediction, customer segmentation, credit default scoring, health risk scoring. Informative data provided, it is often times possible to develop performant AI models which however are neither explainable nor fair and therefore may result in direct or indirect costs if put into production. Hence, my personal goal and passion is about developing highly performing and responsible AI-systems applied to solve real-world challenges in the field of customer analytics.
