I am a former physicist and passionate data scientist with over 10 years of research background in physics, statistics, signal and image processing and over 4 years of industry experience in implementing data science solutions and data science consulting. My personal interest in the field of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) is broad and ranges from the classical machine learning tasks like churn prediction or outlier detection to highly sophisticated deep-learning challenges like computer-vision or natural language processing. 

My special focus is on the development of so-called "responsible" AI systems which are by definition explainable and fair. Model explainability means that the AI decision proccess is highly transparent and understandable. Model fairness means that the AI-system does not decide in favor of or against a specific ethnic or population group. Model explainability and model fairness are thus two important properties for customer analytics use cases like churn prediction, customer-lifetime-value prediction, customer segmentation, credit default scoring, health-risk modeling and many more. Informative data provided, it might often times be possible to develop performant "black-box" AI models which however are neither explainable nor fair and therefore may result in high direct or indirect costs if put into production. My personal goal and passion is about developing highly performant and at the same time responsible AI-systems to solve real-world challenges in the field of customer analytics.

As a freelance data scientist, I would be very happy to work together with you on challenging customer analytics projects to solve real-world challenges using responsible AI.
